<b>Welcome to PyLINS 2.0<b>
This is an updated version of the previously developed software (in C+ coding) in the group called Pralins (Program for Rational Analysis of Libraries in silico) developed by R. Pascual et al. (https://doi.org/10.1023/B:MODI.0000006836.76687.8b) and contains new functions, clustering and partitioning algorithms.
The PyLINS.py script is attached in this repository with an exemplifying Jupyter Notebook (PyLINS.ipynib) file.
The general and recommended methodology followed to obtain the different computational results shown in my thesis project (http://hdl.handle.net/10803/687373) were obtained following the schematic representation shown in Figure 5.2. In order to enable the comprehension of this developed strategy, the next sections will be introduced and described following this workchart:
