# Welcome to PyLINS 2.0

This is an updated version of the previously developed software (in C++ coding) in the group called Pralins (Program for Rational Analysis of Libraries in silico) developed by R. Pascual et al. (https://doi.org/10.1023/B:MODI.0000006836.76687.8b). PyLINS 2.0 contains new functions, clustering, and partitioning algorithms.

## Overview

The `PyLINS.py` script is attached in this repository along with an exemplifying Jupyter Notebook (`PyLINS.ipynb`) file. The general and recommended methodology followed to obtain the different computational results shown in my thesis project (http://hdl.handle.net/10803/687373) were obtained following the schematic representation shown in Figure 5.2.

## Methodology

In order to enable the comprehension of this developed strategy, the next sections will be introduced and described following the workchart provided above.

## Usage

To use this code, clone the repository and run the `PyLINS.py` script. The Jupyter Notebook `PyLINS.ipynb` provides an example of how to use the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmanen/ChemicalDiversity.git
cd ChemicalDiversity
python PyLINS.py
